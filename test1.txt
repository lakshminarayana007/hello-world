About Github.
===============
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. 
It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. 
Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, 
and data sets â€“ anything your project needs.

Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
